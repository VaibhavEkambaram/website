		<h2>About this Website</h2>
		<p>This website is built with simple back-to-basics HTML and CSS. I am currently using <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> to host this site, but am considering moving this to a different host in the future.</>
		<p>The design of the site is built with simplicity in mind, and thus should run well on the majority of modern browsers.</>
		<p>If you are interested, the code for this website is freely available on <a href="https://github.com/VaibhavEkambaram/website">Github</a>.</p>
