            <p> Hello there! My name is Vaibhav and it appears that you have found my little corner of the Internet. I live in Wellington, New Zealand and am currently 
			studying for a Bachelor of Engineering (Software Engineering) at Victoria University of Wellington.
			
			<p> I would say that I have quite a wide range of interests, but take particular curiosity in technology (specifically computers) and history.
			

            <h1>Who am I?</h1>
			<p>Online, you may recognise me using the screen name <code>galahad</code> - A reference to Sir Galahad from <i>Monty Python and the Holy Grail</i>.
           
			<p>If you wish to send me something super secret then you can download my PGP public key <a href="pubkey.asc">here</a>.</p>

            <h1>About this website</h1>
            <p>This website is written by myself using basic HTML and CSS, hosted using <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> using a domain from <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Free Parking NZ.</a></p>
			<p>As the site is relatively simple it should work with most modern web browsers such as Chrome/Firefox/Edge. One aspect of this that I very much like
			is that the website should comply with your system's dark/light mode setting for maximum comfy üòä.</p>
		    <p>If you are interested, the code for this website can be found on <a href="https://github.com/VaibhavEkambaram/website">GitHub</a>.</p>
			<p>If you have any suggestions or notice any issues, feel free to send me an email at <a href="mailto:me@vaibhav.se265@gmail.com">vaibhav.se265@gmail.com</a>.</p>
